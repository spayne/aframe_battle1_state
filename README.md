# Background

Kevin Ngo has some guidelines on how to build GUIs here:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-state-component
and refers to a glitch project here:
https://glitch.com/~aframe-building-ui

# What's here
A webpack version of the aframe-building ui project.

# What's hard about that?
Debugging was difficult because it silently fails
* buttons didn't show text.  solution was to set html as the entry point
* enviromnents didn't update. solution was to include the enviroment package

# How to run
npm run start
